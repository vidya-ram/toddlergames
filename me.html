    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm Vidya Ramakrishnan, an engineer based in Bangalore, India. From working in the software industry to a full time mother got me thinking about what I want to do next. Though I have few hobbies like painting, quilling, reading, nothing excited me as much as learning about web development.</p>
    <h3>About this site</h3>
    <p>I have been learning web development out of passion. I was fascinated by HTML5 canvas feature which I have used in the games. Developing the jquery codes for the webpages helped me better understand jquery and I am amazed by the power of it.<br> I got the inspiration for the site while I used to read to my toddler. The learning and games sections was conceived considering a toddler's mindset. Thanks to my daughter who helped me in testing the games. Ofcourse the audio you hear is her's. The drawings are made by me specially for her.<br> Check out the games I developed with <a href="scratch_games.html">Scratch</a>.<br> And special appreciation for wikimedia commons for providing so many freely usable media files.</p>
